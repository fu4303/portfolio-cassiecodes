        <p>😊 I'm Cassie and I make things on the web</p>
        <p>🖥️ During the week I make accessible, progressively enhanced things for <a href="https://clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a></p>
        <p>🦄 In my spare time I make fun, animated things on <a href="https://codepen.io/cassie-codes/">Codepen.</a></p>
        <p>🎤 I sometimes talk about these things, and I'm going to be writing about them more now that I've got my blog started!</p>
